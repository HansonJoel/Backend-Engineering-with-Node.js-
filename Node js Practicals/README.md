# Node.js Practicals

Welcome to my **Node.js Practicals** repository. This repository contains a collection of practical exercises, assignments, and mini-projects that I will complete as I progress in backend engineering with Node.js.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each topic is organized into its own subfolder and typically includes:

- **README.md** – Contains the description of the exercise, assignment, or project.
- **solutions/** – This folder holds the practical assignments and coding exercises for the topic.
- **Mini Projects/** – Contains mini projects relevant to the topic, including:
  - A `README.md` with project details and requirements.
  - Project-specific subfolders and files.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Each topic folder represents a backend concept or feature in Node.js. Examples include:

- **File and Directory Handling**
- **Working with Modules**
- **Event Loop and Event Emitters**
- **Streams and Buffers**
- **HTTP and Servers**
- **Express.js Basics**
- **Middleware & Routing**
- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)**
- ...and more as I progress.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A hands-on learning path for mastering Node.js backend development.
- A personal portfolio of backend development skills and problem-solving approaches.
- A reference point for revising key backend concepts with real-world code examples.

## 📌 Note

All code is written and tested using modern Node.js versions (v18+). Each solution or project is self-contained and well-commented for clarity.
