# 🚀 My First Express.js Server

This project marks an important milestone in my **Backend Engineering journey**.

Over the past month, I have been working extensively with **core Node.js modules** such as:

- **`http`** – for creating servers
- **`fs`** – for handling file operations
- **`path`** – for managing file paths

After building servers from scratch with these modules, I transitioned into using **Express.js** to see how frameworks can make backend development faster, cleaner, and more scalable.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is my **first server built with Express.js**. It demonstrates:

- Setting up an Express.js application
- Creating routes for different endpoints (`/` and `/contact`)
- Running the server on a defined port

✨ Key Takeaways

Routing in Express.js is much simpler compared to pure Node.js.

Less boilerplate code → more focus on logic.

Express.js provides a scalable structure for building robust APIs.
