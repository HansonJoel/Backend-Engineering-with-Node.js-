# ðŸ”— Node.js Stream Pipes Tutorial

This repository documents my learning progress as I advance my backend development skills using **Node.js**.  
In this tutorial, I explored how to use the **`.pipe()`** method to efficiently transfer data from a **readable stream** to a **writable stream**â€”a key concept in working with streams in Node.js.

---

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

- How to use the **`fs` (File System)** module to create readable and writable streams.
- How to simplify stream operations using the **`.pipe()`** method.
- The importance of **encoding** (e.g., `'utf8'`) to ensure the data is processed as human-readable text.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- The **`.pipe()`** method automatically handles reading and writing between streams without the need for manual event listeners like `.on('data')`.
- It is:
  - âœ… **Efficient**
  - âœ… **Concise**
  - âœ… **Memory-friendly**
- Using `{ encoding: 'utf8' }` ensures the streams handle **text** instead of binary **Buffers**.

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

- Learn how to **chain multiple pipes** for transforming data (e.g., **compression**, **encryption**).
- Explore using pipes with **HTTP requests and responses** (e.g., **file downloads**, **uploads**).
- Apply piping in real-world applications such as:
  - ðŸ”„ **File transformation**
  - ðŸš€ **Streamed file uploads**
  - ðŸŽ¬ **Video/audio streaming**

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Purpose

This repository is part of my continuous journey learning **Backend Engineering with Node.js at AltSchool Africa**.  
I am committed to sharing my learning process by regularly uploading **practical code examples**, **tutorials**, and **key takeaways**.
