# 🌐 Simple Node.js Server

This is a basic **HTTP server** built using **Node.js**. It listens on `localhost` at port `8000` and responds to incoming requests with a plain text message.

## 📚 What I Learned

Today, I learned how to:

- ✅ Set up a simple HTTP server using Node.js.
- ✅ Handle incoming requests and send responses.
- ✅ Understand key server concepts such as:
  - **Hostname**
  - **Port**
  - **Request and Response Objects**
- ✅ The purpose of:
  - **req (Incoming request object)**
  - **res (Outgoing response object)**
  - **res.writeHead() for setting status codes and headers**
  - **res.end() to send the final response**

---

🔮 Next Steps
I plan to continue learning by:

- Adding route handling for different paths.

- Sending JSON and HTML responses.

- Exploring Express.js for easier server management.
